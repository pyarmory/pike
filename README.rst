Pike is a dynamic plugin management library for Python. Unlike most Python
plugin managers, Pike allows for you to load Python packages from anywhere
on a filesystem without complicated configuration. This enables applications
to easily add the ability to expand their functionality through plugin modules.
In addition to plugin management, Pike also includes a set of discovery
functions for custom module and class discovery.
